# Devrant content saver

Devrant is dying. Save your content before it's too late.

# Usage

1. Install Node.js and NPM
2. Clone this repo
3. In index.js, change devrant user id to your user id. See https://devrantapi.docs.apiary.io for more info
4. npm start (or, node index.js)

This thing will save rants and pics. Pics saving is rough, but it will eventually save them all and exit correctly.
